## Policies and Procedures

This repository contains the official Policies and Procedures (P&P) of the Open Source Robotics Alliance, an initiative of the Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc.
The P&P documents are published to [the OSRA website](https://osralliance.org/).

Each Markdown document is one P&P document, with a specific scope.
Example scopes are the Technical Governance Committee (TGC), a single Project, and a sub-committee of the TGC.

The versions of the P&P documents in the `main` branch are the most-recently-ratified versions.
Proposed revisions are kept in branches of this repository (or forks, if being proposed by people outside the OSRF).
These branches must go through a pull request to be merged into `main`, and one requirement for merging a pull request is that the revisions are ratified by the appropriate body of the OSRF or OSRA.
The appropriate bodies are:

1. *TGC P&P*: Revisions must be approved by the TGC and ratified by the OSRF Board of Directors (including proxy by officers of the OSRF).

1. *Project Charters*: Revisions must be ratified by the TGC.
   New charters must be approved by the TGC and ratified by the OSRF Board of Directors.

1. *Project repository lists*: Revisions must be ratified by the Project Management Committee for the relevant Project.

1. *Special Interest Group Charters*: Revisions and new Charters must be ratified by the TGC.

1. *Technical Committee Charters*: Revisions and new Charters must be ratified by the TGC.

1. *Working Group Charters*: Revisions and new Charters must be ratified by the Project Management Committee for the relevant Project.

To propose changes to one of the P&P documents, fork this repository, make your proposed changes, open a pull request, and then have the proposed changes brought before the appropriate body.
If you are not a member of the appropriate body, you should speak to your representative on that body to have your proposed changes added to the agenda of a future meeting.
For most people, this will be the Sponsoring Individuals Representative on either a PMC or the TGC.
